# Introduction

The analysis in the report is regarding **building certification lodgements** in the Townsville local government area. **Townsville is a city and a major port area in eastern Queensland, Australia.** Two data sets have been combined and used for the analysis from the  [www.data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au) website. 

First data set i.e. the building approval details have been extracted from [here](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tcc-building-approvals) ("Townsville City Council Building Approvals - data.gov.au", 2021) and includes number of building approvals from 2009 to 2021 and their corresponding details e.g. Decision, Class, Suburb etc. And the second data set i.e. City of Townsville's Suburb geometry has been extracted from [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-81cbbedc-e35f-4266-980d-21a6159b2404/distribution/dist-dga-28812258-4cf4-46aa-aa43-0206d7c60920/details?q=) ("Townsville Suburbs - data.gov.au.", 2021) and includes the geometrical values for these Suburbs.

This report has been complied using R Studio ("RStudio Team", 2020), [Github](https://github.com/PranaliAngne/Team_Amigos_5513Assignment4) ("GitHub: Where the world builds software", 2021), Gitkraken("GitKraken Documentation", 2021) and Atom("A hackable text editor for the 21st Century", 2021).

**Project Details**

- Name: **Analyzing Building approvals data for the City of Townsville** (Assignment 4, ETC5513)

- Objective: Answering research questions regarding Year, Approvals, Class, Category, Suburb and Estimated Cost for Building Approvals in the city of Townsville.

**Research Questions**

1. To identify the year with maximum approvals and to analyze the data further to find out the suburb and estimate cost of building with respect to the most popular class in that year. And also find out the category that is most in demand for that class.

2. To analyze the suburb which was inferred from research question 1 and find out the year for which it had the maximum approvals. Also find out the class that occurred maximum times, category with respect to that class and estimate cost for these particular variables.

```


```{r reading-data, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
data <-read_csv("data/building-approvals.csv")
geometry <- read_csv("data/suburbs.csv")
join <- left_join(data, geometry)
```

```{r data-cleaning, echo=FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
question0 <- join %>% dplyr :: select (`Application Type`, 
                                      `Date Of Decision Notice`,
                                      Decision,

                                    `Estimated Cost` ,
                                      Suburb,
                                    Latitude,

                                      )
```

**Variable Names**

After data cleaning according to our research questions, we will be selecting the following variables:

```{r tab1, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width= "3%"}
summary <- colnames(question0)
knitr::kable(summary, col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(summary)), align = "l", caption = "Variable Names") %>% 
kable_paper("hover")
```

For table \@ref(tab:tab1), the **description of the variables** used in the data set:

+ **Application type**: Here, application for 'building certification lodgements'.

+ **Date of decision notice**: The date the building certifier made a notice that the works met the building codes.

+ **Decision**: Current status of the works as recorded with Council.

+ **Class**: The building classification as per the list on page one.

+ **Sub-category (Council category descriptors)**: This category is a subdivision of class. Provides information regarding additions, alterations, subdwell etc in it.

+ **Category**: Townsville City Council has published on its website for a number of years a summary of building approval data using the certain categories.

+ **Estimated values**: The monetary value of the proposed building work.

+ **Suburb**: The suburb where the building work is taking place.

+ **Latitude and Longitude**: Geometrical dimensions. 

## Answering **Research Question 1.**

### Finding **Year** with **maximum approvals** as a decision, overall.

```{r graph1, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height= 5, fig.width=9, fig.cap= "Year v/s Decision count", fig.pos='H', fig.align='center'}
question1 <- question0 %>% 
  mutate(`Date Of Decision Notice` = dmy(`Date Of Decision Notice`),
        Year = year(`Date Of Decision Notice`))

question1.1 <- question1 %>% 
  select(Year, Decision) %>% 
  count(Decision, Year) %>% 
  rename(`Total number of Decision` = n)

# plotting this graph
graph1 <- ggplot(data = question1.1, aes(x = Year,
                             y = `Total number of Decision`, 
                             fill = Decision)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  theme_get() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Total count of Decision") 

ggplotly(graph1)
```

From the graph \@ref(fig:graph1), we see that, **finalized projects have maximum count**, but we will **consider the count of approved projects** into consideration because: 

Finalized projects are projects sent by architects to be approved by the regulation committee and the approved projects are the **confirmed** projects. Thus, it makes more sense to consider approved projects over finalized while deciding the **best year**.

+ The year **2020** has maximum **approvals** till now.

### Finding **class** occuring in maximum suburbs and finding its total count, for approved projects in 2020.

*(Keeping, 'Year as 2020' and 'Decision as Approved', constant)*

```{r class, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
question2 <- question1 %>% 
  filter(Decision %in% c("#Approved"),
         Year=="2020")
```

```{r plot2, fig.cap= "Distribution of class in Townsville's subrub area's", message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, fig.height= 5, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
map <- qmplot(Longitude, Latitude, data = question2 , size = I(1.5), darken = .3, fill= Class) 
ggplotly(map)
```

In figure (map) \@ref(fig:plot2), using *plotly*, we observe that **Class 1a** occurs in maximum suburbs.

```{r tab2, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
question2.1 <- question2 %>% 
  select(Year, Class) %>% 
  group_by(Year, Class) %>% 
  count(Class) %>% 
  rename(Count_of_Class = n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Count_of_Class))
knitr::kable(head(question2.1), caption = "Count of class for approved projects") %>% 
   kable_paper("hover", full_width = T) %>% 
  row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#D7261E")
```

Table \@ref(tab:tab2) gives us the total count of Class 1a. It shows that **Class 1a** has the **maximum count** out of all the other classes.

**Class 1a includes :Single dwelling, detached house, town house or villa unit.**

From figure \@ref(fig:plot2) and table \@ref(tab:tab2), we were able to find out that the class 1a occurs in most suburbs. Each suburbs can have *multiple class 1a projects*.

+ Not only does it occur in most of the suburbs, but also these projects have a maximum count among all other projects.

+ Therefore, **Class 1a** occurs for most areas and maximum no. of times for *approved projects* in the year *2020*.





\section*{Q1, Part B}

``` {r libraries, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
library(readr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(randomcoloR)
library(plotly)
library(gapminder)
```

```{r reading_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
sec2 <-read_csv("data/building-approvals.csv") %>% 
  mutate(`Date Of Decision Notice` = dmy(`Date Of Decision Notice`),
        Year = year(`Date Of Decision Notice`)) 
```

### Finding **category** with maximum counts in Class 1a (approved projects), in 2020.

*(Keeping, 'Decision as Approved' and 'Class as 1a', constant and showing variation for years and identifying category count for 'Year 2020')*

```{r filtering, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
Filtered <- sec2 %>%  
  filter(Class == "Class 1a", Decision == "#Approved")
grouping <- Filtered %>% 
    group_by(Category, Year) %>% 
  count(Category) %>% 
  rename(Count =n)
```

```{r fig3, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Count v/s Category", fig.height= 5, fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}
df <- grouping
fig <- df %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~Category, 
    y = ~Count, 
    color = ~Category, 
    frame = ~Year, 
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers'
  )
fig
```

In figure \@ref(fig:fig3), by clicking on *play*, we observe that for half the years in the data set, *Residential-Other* category has been on the top and for the other half, *Single Detached Dwelling-New* has been in demand.

+ Identifying for the year 2020, we see that out of *Class 1a*, **Residential-Other** category is most in demand out of *approved projects* in the year *2020*.

### Finding **Suburb** for Residential category (Class 1a), approved projects in 2020.

*(Keeping, 'Year as 2020'. 'Decision as Approved', 'Class as 1a' and 'Category as Residential-Other', constant)*

```{r colours, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
 c50 <- c(
  "dodgerblue2", "#E31A1C",  "green4", "#6A3D9A",  "#FF7F00", "black", "gold1", "skyblue2", "#FB9A99", "palegreen2", "#CAB2D6", "#FDBF6F","gray70", "khaki2", "maroon", "orchid1", "deeppink1", "blue1", "steelblue4",
  "darkturquoise", "green1", "yellow4", "yellow3", "darkorange4", "brown", "pink1", "violet", "mediumpurple1", "slateblue1", "purple", "purple3",
"turquoise2", "skyblue", "steelblue", "blue2", "navyblue", "orange", "tomato", "coral2", "palevioletred", "violetred", "red2","springgreen2", "yellowgreen", "palegreen4", "wheat2", "tan", "tan2", "tan3", "brown",
 "grey70", "grey50", "grey30"
)
```

```{r fig4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.cap= "Suburb v/s Approval Count", fig.align='center'}
polar <- Filtered %>% 
  filter(Year == "2020") %>% 
  filter( Category == "Residential - Other") %>% 
  select(Suburb, Decision, Category, Year ) %>% 
  group_by(Suburb) %>% 
count(Decision) %>% 
  rename(Total_Approvals = n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total_Approvals))

ggplot(polar,
       aes(y = Total_Approvals, x = Suburb, fill = Suburb)) +
  geom_col() +
 coord_polar() +
scale_fill_manual(values = c50) +
theme(axis.text = element_blank())
```

Figure \@ref(fig:fig4) shows that suburbs *Kirwan* and *Hermit Park* have the maximum approval count.

+ Therefore, the suburbs **Kirwan** and **Hermit Park**, have most no. of *class 1a*'s with category as *Residential-Other* in *approved projects* for *2020*.

### Estimated **cost(x)** for research question 1.

By *(Keeping, 'Year as 2020'. 'Decision as Approved', 'Class as 1a' and 'Category as Residential-Other', constant)*

```{r estimated-cost, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
cost <- sec2 %>% 
    filter(Year == "2020", Class == "Class 1a", Decision == "#Approved", Category == "Residential - Other") %>% 
  rename(Estimated_Cost = `Estimated Cost`) %>% 
mutate(Estimated.Cost = as.factor(Estimated_Cost)) 
  cost$Estimated.Cost = as.numeric(gsub("[\\$,]", "", cost$Estimated.Cost)) 
```


```{r tab3, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
kirwan <- cost %>% 
  filter(Suburb == "Kirwan") 
k <- sum(kirwan$Estimated.Cost)
knitr::kable(head(k), caption = "Estimated cost for Kirwan") %>% 
   kable_paper("hover") %>% 
  row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "black", background = "white")
```

Table \@ref(tab:tab3) displays the cost for Kirwan in best year 2020.

```{r tab4, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
hermit_park <- cost %>% 
  filter(Suburb == "Hermit Park") 
hp <- sum(hermit_park$Estimated.Cost)
knitr::kable(head(hp), caption = "Estimated cost for Hermit Park") %>% 
   kable_paper("hover") %>% 
  row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "black", background = "#87CEEB")
```

Table \@ref(tab:tab4) displays the cost for Hermit Park in best year 2020.

```{r tab5, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
s <- sum(k,hp)
knitr::kable(head(s), caption = "Total estimated cost for research question 1") %>% 
   kable_paper("hover") %>% 
  row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "black", background = "yellow")
```

+ Therefore by observing table \@ref(tab:tab5), we know that the **total cost** for suburbs *Kirwan* and *Hermit Park*'s *class 1a* *approved* projects(*Residential-Other* category) in *2020* is **$2,068,312**

        Year = year(`Date Of Decision Notice`))
```

### Finding the **Year** for **maximum approvals** in **Kirwan** and **Hermit Park**.

*(Keeping, 'Decision as Approved' and 'Suburbs as Kirwan and Hermit Park', constant)*

```{r fig5, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap= "Year v/s Approval Count with respect to Suburbs", fig.align='center', fig.height= 5, fig.width= 9}
plot <- Section3 %>%

  filter(Decision %in% c("#Approved")) %>% 
   group_by(Year, Decision, Suburb) %>% 
  count(Decision) %>%

Fig <- ggplot(data = plot, aes(x = Year,
                             y = Decision_count, 
                             fill = Suburb)) +

scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("GrandBudapest1", n = 2))+
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Approval Count") 

ggplotly(Fig)
```

+ From \@ref(fig:fig5), it is evident that for **Kirwan**, the **maximum approvals** occurred in **2021** and for **Hermit Park**, the year was **2020**.

### Finding **class** that occurs most no. of times for *approved projects* in *Kirwan* and *Hermit Park*, in *2021* and *2020* respectively.

*(Keeping, 'Decision as Approved', 'Suburbs as Kirwan and Hermit Park', Year as 2021 (for Kirwan) and 2020 (for Hermit Park), constant)*

```{r tab6, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
table1 <- Section3 %>% 
  filter(Suburb == "Kirwan", Decision == "#Approved", Year == "2021") 
 
tab6 <- table1 %>% 
  group_by(Year, Class, Suburb, Decision) %>% 
  count(Class) %>% 
  rename(Class_count = n) %>% 
arrange(desc(Class_count))
knitr::kable(head(tab6), caption = "Count of Class in Kirwan in 2021") %>% 
   kable_paper("hover") %>% 
  row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#D7261E")
```

+ From \@ref(tab:tab6) it is clear that **Class 10a** occurs for most no. of times for *approved projects* in *Kirwan* in *2021*.

**Class 10a includes : Private garage, carport or shed**

```{r tab7, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
table2 <- Section3 %>% 
  filter(Suburb == "Hermit Park", Decision == "#Approved", Year == "2020") 
tab7 <- table2 %>% 
  group_by(Year, Class, Suburb, Decision) %>% 
  count(Class) %>% 
  rename(Class_count = n) %>% 
arrange(desc(Class_count))
knitr::kable(head(tab7), caption = "Count of Class in Hermit Park in 2020") %>% 
   kable_paper("hover") %>% 
  row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#D7261E")
```

+ From \@ref(tab:tab7) it is clear that **Class 1a** occurs for most no. of times for *approved projects* in *Hermit Park* in *2020*.


Class 1a having maximum count matches with table \@ref(tab:tab2), where also, Class 1a had maximum count in 2020.

```

### Out of *Class 10a* and *Class 1a*, finding **category** that is most in demand for *approved projects* in *Kirwan(2020)* and *Hermit Park(2021)* respectively.

*(Keeping, 'Decision as Approved','Suburbs as Kirwan and Hermit Park',constant.*
 *Keeping 'Year as 2021' and 'Class as 10a' constant for Kirwan.*
 *Keeping 'Year as 2020' and 'Class as 1a' constant for Hermit Park.)*

```

The figure \@ref(fig:fig6) displays two polar graphs with category count in Kirwan(left) and category count in Hermit Park(right).

+ It is evident from both the graphs that the **Residential-Other** category for *approved projects*, is in demand for *both suburbs* and *both classes* in their respective *years*.


### Estimated **cost(x)** for research question 2.

*(Keeping, 'Decision as Approved', 'Category as Residential-Other','Suburbs as Kirwan   and Hermit Park',constant.*
*Keeping 'Year as 2021' and 'Class as 10a' constant for Kirwan.*
*Keeping 'Year as 2020' and 'Class as 1a' constant for Hermit Park.)*

```{r kirwan-filter, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
Ecost <- catK %>% 
  rename(Estimated_Cost = `Estimated Cost`) %>% 
mutate(Estimated.Cost = as.factor(Estimated_Cost))

```

```{r tab8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
Kcost <- Ecost %>% 
    filter(Category == "Residential - Other") 
Ksum <- sum(Kcost$Estimated.Cost) 
    knitr::kable(head(Ksum), caption = "Total estimated cost for research question 2 (Kirwan)") %>% 
   kable_paper("hover") %>% 
  row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "black", background = "white")
```

Table \@ref(tab:tab8) displays the cost for Kirwan in 2021.

```{r hp-filter, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
Ecosthp <- catHP %>% 
  rename(Estimated_Cost = `Estimated Cost`) %>%

   kable_paper("hover") %>% 
  row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "black", background = "#87CEEB")
```

Table \@ref(tab:tab9) displays the cost for Hermit Park in best year 2020. And **this observation is similar to table \@ref(tab:tab4).**

+ Therefore by observing table \@ref(tab:tab8), we know that the **total cost** for suburb *Kirwan* for *class 10a* *approved* projects(*Residential-Other* category) in *2020* is **$511,371**.

+ And from \@ref(tab:tab9), we know that the **total cost** for suburb *Hermit Park* for *class 1a* *approved* projects(*Residential-Other* category) in *2021* is **$1,074,668**.
