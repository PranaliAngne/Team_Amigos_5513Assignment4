# Project Details
- **Name**: Analyzing Building approvals data for the City of Townsville** (Assignment 4, ETC5513)

- **Objective**: Answering research questions regarding Year, Approvals, Class, Category, Suburb and Estimated Cost for Building Approvals in the city of Townsville.

- **Date set used** : 

First data set i.e. the building approval details have been extracted from [here](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tcc-building-approvals) from the website [www.data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au). 

And the second data set i.e. City of Townsville's Suburb geometry has been extracted from [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-81cbbedc-e35f-4266-980d-21a6159b2404/distribution/dist-dga-28812258-4cf4-46aa-aa43-0206d7c60920/details?q=) from the website [www.data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au). 

The Building Approvals data set produced by Townsville City Council contains information about most of the building work that has been approved in the Townsville local government area. This information is used by industry and government as a key economic indicator.
